# Title: Verilog Implementation of a MIPS 32 Processor

#Project Summary:
The "Verilog Implementation of a MIPS 32 Processor" project aims to design and implement a simplified version of the MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) 32-bit architecture using the Verilog hardware description language. The project focuses on creating a functional processor core that can execute a subset of MIPS instructions while adhering to the principles of pipelining and data path design.
